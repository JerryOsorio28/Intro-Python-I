# When you use a variable in a function, it's local in scope to the function.
x = 12

def changeX():
    #the 'global' indicates that we want to search for a variable with the name 'x' that was declared in the global scope.
    global x

changeX()

# This prints 12. What do we have to modify in changeX() to get it to print 99?
print(x)


# This nested function has a similar problem.

def outer():
    y = 120

    def inner():
        # the 'nonlocal' indicates that the declared variable that we want to use is the local one
        nonlocal y
        y = 999

    inner()

    # This prints 120. What do we have to change in inner() to get it to print
    # 999? Google "python nested function scope".
    print(y)

outer()
